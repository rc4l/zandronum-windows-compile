== Enable Mercurial extensions ==
'''This section is optional''', and is required only if you intend to build a specific topic. Doing so requires the <tt>topic</tt> and <tt>evolve</tt> extensions to be enabled. Some distros may package these separately from the base Mercurial package, so check your package manager. Alternatively, it is possible to install evolve from the Python Package Index, see [https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/evolve/-/blob/branch/default/README.rst the evolve readme] for more information.

Add the following to the <tt>extensions</tt> section of <tt>~/.hgrc</tt>:

<syntaxhighlight lang="ini">
[extensions]
topic = 
evolve = 
</syntaxhighlight>

== Clone source repository ==
Clone the Zandronum source repository, and change your working directory to it:

<pre>
hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/zandronum/zandronum-stable
cd zandronum-stable
</pre>

== Check out desired version ==

=== Stable release ===

Tags are available for stable releases of Zandronum.
See [[Version history]] for all releases and their tags.
For example, to check out the latest stable release ([[Version history/{{LatestVersion}}|{{LatestVersion}}]]), use:

 hg update ZA_{{LatestVersion}}
{{#if:{{LatestBeta}}:

=== Latest beta release ===

Currently, no tags are available for beta releases. To check out a beta, you must find its changeset hash. A table of betas and their hashes is available on the relevant article for that version - for the current beta release, see [[Version history/{{LatestBeta}}#Beta builds|here]].

For example, to check out the latest beta release ([[Version history/{{LatestBeta}}|{{LatestBeta}}]]), use:

 hg update {{LatestBetaChangeset}}
}}

== Build client ==

=== Download FMOD ===

Download FMOD 4.44.64 and extract the files:

<pre>
wget https://zandronum.com/essentials/fmod/fmodapi44464linux.tar.gz
tar xf fmodapi44464linux.tar.gz
</pre>

Make a note of where you extracted FMOD.

=== Compile ===

In the directory where you cloned Zandronum, create and move into a directory for the build files:

 mkdir buildclient
 cd buildclient

Then, use CMake to generate the Makefiles.

Replace <code>/path/to/fmodapi44464linux</code> in the commands below with where you extracted FMOD.

 cmake \
  -DFMOD_LIBRARY=/path/to/fmodapi44464linux/api/lib/libfmodex64-4.44.64.so \
  -DFMOD_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/fmodapi44464linux/api/inc \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN=ON \
  ..

Then build:

 make -j`nproc`

A <code>zandronum</code> binary will be output to the build directory.

== Build server-only ==

Note that the client build is also a server build when using the <code>-host</code> command-line parameter. If you built a client above, then '''building server-only is unneccesary'''.

Return to the directory which Zandronum was cloned to, and create and move into another directory for building:

 mkdir buildserver
 cd buildserver

Then, use CMake to generate the Makefiles:
 cmake \
  -DSERVERONLY=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  ..

Then build:

 make -j`nproc`

A <code>zandronum-server</code> binary will be output to the build directory.
