Analyze the compiling linux, and compiling windows. Let me know when you're done. We are trying to compile Zandronum on windows within a single script using a terminal only with no arguments or any nonsense. Just run and go. There are some unbreakable rules:

1. We want a touchless approach meaning no patching or modifying the Zandronum source code no matter what.
2. We want to maintain portability so nothing can be hardcoded for a path nor should it ever install anything "globally" on your windows machine.
3. We want to create a system where it's a one-stop-shop to compile zandronum on windows. There should be no compromises whatsoever. No skipping fmod, or anything.
4. For source control we will try to use git and github using https://github.com/TorrSamaho/zandronum
5. The end result should involve a successful windows build of Zandronum for windows with no compromises. And eventually a ready-to-use workspace for vscode so developers can just go start coding.

Got it? For now research solutions thoroughly and find me good answers.
